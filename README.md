### Description:

     Our web application starts with a login page where you can also choose to create a new user if you have never logged in before.<br />
     The application will not let you choose a username that has already been used, and it ensures that you type in your password the<br />
     same way twice. The passwords are hashed in the database. Once you have created a username and password, log in! <br />
     Welcome to our neural network! You will see a nav bar that allows you to return to this page, see the running data table, or logout.<br />
     Instructions for how to use the home page are on the page. Write a number of your choice and click submit, and our neural <br />
     network will read what you wrote! If it's correct, click the green check; if not, type in what the prediction should have been. <br />
     If you would like to see all the input data, click the Data Table tab on the nav bar! You can delete others' input if it <br />
     appears that they are not writing numbers or update the tags if they missed them. Have fun and don't forget to logout!<br />
     
     Machine learning and neural networks are only increasing in relevance in our day and age, so even if we are just starting with<br />
     numbers, we are learning how neural networks work and predict. With AI technology becoming more mainstream, our applications <br />
     helped build a foundation of knowledge for us on the topic and a foundation of character detecting for any machine!<br />

### Explanation
Our app is CREATING when we add users in the Create User Page AND when we add new digit drawings to the Data Table.<br />
Our app is READING when we verify your login.<br />
Our app is UPDATING if you choose to update the tag predictions on the digit drawings in Data Table.<br />
Our app is DELETING if you want to delete any of the drawings.<br />
