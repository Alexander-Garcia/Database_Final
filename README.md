### Description:

     Our web application starts with a login page where you can also choose to create a new user if you have never logged in before. The application will not let you choose a username that has already been used, and it ensures that you type in your password the same way twice. The passwords are hashed in the database. Once you have created a username and password, log in! Welcome to our neural network! You will see a nav bar that allows you to return to this page, see the running data table, or logout. Instructions for how to use the home page are on the page. Write a number of your choice and click submit, and our neural network will read what you wrote! If it's correct, click the green check; if not, type in what the prediction should have been. If you would like to see all the input data, click the Data Table tab on the nav bar! You can delete others' input if it appears that they are not writing numbers or update the tags if they missed them. Have fun and don't forget to logout!
     Machine learning and neural networks are only increasing in relevance in our day and age, so even if we are just starting with numbers, we are learning how neural networks work and predict. With AI technology becoming more mainstream, our applications helped build a foundation of knowledge for us on the topic and a foundation of character detecting for any machine!
